Challenges Faced
Technical Hurdles:
JavaFx Integration: 
The original idea was to use JavaFX to create a more complex graphical user interface (GUI) with improved visual components and interactive features. 
IDE Compatibility Issues:
Regrettably, our Integrated Development Environment (IDE) ran into problems with JavaFX libraries during the development stage, which led to unforeseen mistakes and complicated the implementation process.
Fallback to Command Line Interface (CLI):
We strategically chose to utilize conventional input/output operations for user interaction in a command-line interface (CLI) method in order to overcome this difficulty and guarantee project continuance. 
Impact on User Experience:
Although the CLI solution successfully fulfilled the project's functional needs, it presented drawbacks in terms of user friendliness and aesthetic appeal when compared to the JavaFX-based GUI that was initially intended.
